# **Data structures in C just for fun**
## I resolved to review the concepts that I saw in Data Structures class in college.
## Could be playing some game, but a nerd is a nerd.

As you already here, this is what you'll find:

* Codes with some lists concepts implemented;
* The same for stacks and queues (I intend...);
* Maybe some exercises too;
* Non-sense commentaries;
* Bad english grammar;
