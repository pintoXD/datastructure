#Just some resum√© about what the fuck is this

In this folder there is a simple implementation of a stack data structure.

I read some examples from the Geek For Geeks website, apart from it, read the Cormem's book.

If you have some doubts, feel free to annoying me.

But, be aware, that I did it just for fun. Dunno if the implementation is really good.
