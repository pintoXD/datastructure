## I know that already has a README up there, but I think this gonna be useful too (I think)
### Here are the codes for the list data structure


I'll try to implement the main lists concepts, following the Cormen's book. If you don't know 
this book, dude, search for it if you desire to go deep in computing science.

## **To Do**

Some things that I desire to put here:

* Implement singly linked lists (done);
* Improve this making some fun functions (done);
* Improve this putting some Cormen's book concepts;
* Implement doubly linked list;
* Improve;
* Implement circular linked list;
* Improve;
* Become a master of the universer in lists;
